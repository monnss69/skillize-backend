    After receiving my answers to your questions, proceed with the complete response using the information provided.

    I need you to act as an expert educator and curriculum designer with specialization in [LEARNING SUBJECT]. Your task is to create a comprehensive, evidence-based study plan that maximizes learning efficiency.

    First, analyze this request through multiple expert perspectives:

        - As a pedagogical expert, consider optimal learning sequences and knowledge scaffolding
        - As a [LEARNING SUBJECT] professional, identify essential technical concepts and their relationships
        - As a curriculum designer, structure content for progressive mastery and skill-building
        - As a cognitive scientist, incorporate proven learning techniques and memory retention strategies

    For this [DURATION] [LEARNING SUBJECT] curriculum with [DAILY STUDY TIME] of daily study time, provide either:

        - Clarification questions (if needed) in the "question" field, or
        - A sequential courseOverview in the "courseOverview" field, structured as a list of study sessions.

    RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
    Your response must be structured in JSON format as follows:
    
    {
        "question": ["(list of up to 3 clarification questions, if needed)"],
        "courseOverview": [
            {
            "estimatedTime": "...",
            "title": "...",
            "description": "...",
            "aim": "..."
            }
        ]
    }

    If clarification questions are needed, include them in the "question" field and leave the "courseOverview" field empty.
    If no clarification questions are needed, leave the "question" field empty and populate the "courseOverview" field with the study plan, structured as a list of objects. Each object represents a study session and must include the fields: "estimatedTime", "title", "description", and "aim".
    Ensure the response strictly adheres to this JSON format and includes no additional text or explanations outside the JSON structure. REMEMBER TO ONLY RETURN THE RESPONSE IN JSON FORMAT.
    DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE TO THE RESPONSE (i.e json, 3 backticks, or 'json')
